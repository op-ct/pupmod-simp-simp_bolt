This suite is intended to install Bolt then test Bolt by installing the
hirs_provisioner module on target systems.  To run the tests, execute:
``bundle exec rake beaker:suites[with_hirs]``

As of 4/7/2020 HIRS  will not run on EL8.  It needs to be, at the very
least, recompiled in EL8.  So the nodeset for this test does not
include and EL8 client.
